// 14.Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

let guest_list : string[] = ["kainat", "Maham","Marium","ayesha"]

for (let i=0; i<guest_list.length; i++){

   console.log(`Dear Miss`+" " + guest_list[i] + `,\n\nplease come to my birthday party\n\n\t\t thank you\t\t`)
}
